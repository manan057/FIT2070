Fork creates new processes, a process that is created is an exact copy of the process calling fork
So before the fork is executed, there is just the one process and when the fork returns
there are two â€“ and both are executing at the same point in the code.
For the parent process the value of pid is some positive integer and in the child its value is zero.
